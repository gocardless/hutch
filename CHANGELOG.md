## 0.22.0 — (unreleased)

### Configurable Consumer Thread Pool Exception Handling (MRI only)

`:consumer_pool_abort_on_exception` is a new option
(defaults to `false`) which defines whether Bunny's
consumer work pool threads should abort on exception.
The option is ignored on JRuby.

### Uses stdlib json instead of multi_json gem

Contributed by Seamus Abshere.

## 0.21.0 — February 7th, 2016

### JRuby Compatibility Restored

Contributed by Jesper Josefsson.

### More Reliable Rails app Detection

Rails application detection now won't produce false positives
for applications that include `config/environment.rb`. Instead,
`bin/rails` and `script/rails` are used.

Contributed by @bisusubedi.

### Refactoring

Contributed by Jesper Josefsson and Olle Jonsson.


## 0.20.0 — November 16th, 2015

### Hutch::Exception includes Bunny::Exception

`Hutch::Exception` now inherits from `Bunny::Exception` which
inherits from `StandardError`.

GH issue: [#137](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch/issues/137).


### Pluggable (Negative) Acknowledge Handlers

Hutch now can be configured to use a user-provided
object(s) to perform acknowledgement on consumer exceptions.

For example, this is what the default handler looks like:

``` ruby
require 'hutch/logging'
require 'hutch/acknowledgements/base'

module Hutch
  module Acknowledgements
    class NackOnAllFailures < Base
      include Logging

      def handle(delivery_info, properties, broker, ex)
        prefix = "message(#{properties.message_id || '-'}): "
        logger.debug "#{prefix} nacking message"

        broker.nack(delivery_info.delivery_tag)

        # terminates further chain processing
        true
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Handlers are configured similarly to exception notification handlers,
via `:error_acknowledgements` in Hutch config.

Contributed by Derek Kastner.

GH issue: [#177](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch/pull/177).


### Configurable Exchange Properties

`:mq_exchange_options` is a new config option that can be used
to provide a hash of exchange attributes (durable, auto-delete).
The options will be passed directly to Bunny (or March Hare, when
running on JRuby).

Contributed by Derek Kastner.

GH issue: [#170](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch/pull/170).


### Bunny Update

Bunny is updated to 2.2.1.


## 0.19.0 — September 7th, 2015

### Pluggable Serialisers

Hutch now supports pluggable serialisers: see `Hutch::Serializer::JSON` for
an example. Serialiser is configured via Hutch config as a Ruby
class.

Contributed by Dmitry Galinsky.


### multi_json Update

Hutch now depends on multi_json `1.11.x`.

### Bunny Update

Bunny is updated to [2.2.0](http://blog.rubyrabbitmq.info/blog/2015/09/06/bunny-2-dot-2-0-is-released/).

### More Bunny SSL Options

`:mq_tls_ca_certificates` and `:mq_verify_peer` options will now be passed on to Bunny as `:tls_ca_certificates` and `:verify_peer` respectively.

Contributed by Kennon Ballou.

## 0.18.0 — August 16th, 2015

### JRuby Support (Using March Hare)

Hutch will now use March Hare when running on JRuby.
This will yield significant throughput and core utilisation
improvements for workloads with many and/or busy consumers.

Contributed by Teodor Pripoae.


### Configurable Consumer Thread Pool Size

`:consumer_pool_size` is a new option (defaults to `1`) which defines
Bunny consumer work pool size.

Contributed by Derek Kastner.

### Bunny Logger Option

`:client_logger` is a new option that allows
for configuring loggerd used by Bunny, the underlying
RabbitMQ client library.

Contributed by Nate Salisbury.


## 0.17.0 — July 19th, 2015

Fixes an issue with `NoMethodError` in `Hutch::Config`.


## 0.16.0 — July 19th, 2015

### Support amqps URIs

Hutch now automatically enables TLS and changes default port
when URI scheme is `amqps`.

Contributed by Carl Hörberg.

### Hash With Indifferent Access

Hutch now uses `HashWithIndifferentAccess` internally
to reduce use of symbols (which are not garbage collected
by widely used Ruby versions).

Contributed by Teodor Pripoae.


## 0.15.0 — May 5th, 2015

### Airbrake Error Handler

Contributed by Nate Salisbury.

### Ruby 1.9 Support Dropped

Ruby 1.9 is no longer supported by Hutch (and soon Bunny 2.0).
1.9 is also no longer maintained by the Ruby core team.

### Custom Arguments per Consumers

Allow to set custom arguments per consumers by using the `arguments` setter.
Arguments are usually used by rabbitmq plugins or to set queue policies. You can
find a list of supported arguments [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html).

Contributed by Pierre-Louis Gottfrois.

### Message Processing Tracers

Allow to track message processing by using the `:tracer` config option,
the value should be a class (or fully-qualified string name of a class) that
implements the tracing interface.

A tracer that performs NewRelic instrumentation ships with Hutch
and requires New Relic gem to be loaded.

Contributed by Mirosław Nagaś.

### Added Logger Method to Consumer Module

Consumers can now call a logger method to write to Hutch's log.

Contributed by Matty Courtney

## 0.14.0 — Feb 23rd, 2015

### Configurable Socket Timeouts

Socket read and write timeouts are now configurable using
the `read_timeout` and `write_timeout` options, respectively.

Contributed by Chris Barton.


### Logged Messages as Serialised as JSON

...as opposed to Ruby object printing.

Contributed by Andrew Morton.


### Configurable Heartbeat

Config now supports a new option: `:heartbeat`, which is passed
on to Bunny.

Contributed by Simon Taranto.


### HoneyBadger Error Handler

Contributed by Daniel Farrell.


### Hutch.connected? Now Returns Up-to-Date Value

`Hutch.connected?` no longer relies on an ivar and always returns
an up-to-date value.

Contributed by Pierre-Louis Gottfrois.


## 0.13.0 — Dec 5th, 2014

### HTTP API Can Be Disabled for Consumers

HTTP API use can be disabled for consumers using the `:enable_http_api_use` config
option (defaults to true).



## 0.12.0 — Nov 25th, 2014

### Explicit Requires

Hutch no longer relies on `Kernel#autoload` to load its key
modules and classes.

Contributed by Pierre-Louis Gottfrois.


### hutch --version No Longer Fails

```
hutch --version
```

no longer fails with an exception.

Contributed by Olle Jonsson.


### Base Class for All Hutch Exceptions

All Hutch exceptions now inherit from `Hutch::Exception`.

Contributed by Pierre-Louis Gottfrois.


## 0.11.0 — Nov 14th, 2014

### Publisher Confirms Support

`:force_publisher_confirms` is a new configuration option that forces `Hutch.publish` to wait
for a confirm for every message published. Note that this **will cause a significant drop in throughput**:

``` ruby
Hutch::Config.set(:force_publisher_confirms, true)
```

`Hutch::Broker#confirm_select` and `Hutch::Broker#wait_for_confirms` are new public API methods
that delegate to their respective `Bunny::Channel` counterparts. `Hutch::Broker#confirm_select`
can be used to handle confirms with a callback instead of waiting:

``` ruby
broker.confirm_select do |delivery_tag, multiple, nack|
  # ...
end
```


### Bunny Update

Bunny is updated to [1.6.0](http://blog.rubyrabbitmq.info/blog/2014/10/31/bunny-1-dot-6-0-is-released/).


## 0.10.0 — Oct 22, 2014

### Configuration via URI

Hutch now supports a new configuration key, `:uri`, which allows
connection configuration via a URI.

Note that since the URI has to include credentials, this option
is not available on the command line.

### Bunny Update

Bunny is updated to `1.5.1`, which mitigates the POODLE attack
by disabling SSL 3.0 where possible.

### Payload in Error Handlers

Error handlers will now have access to message payload.

Contributed by Daniel Farrell.

### Exceptions in Error Handlers Don't Prevent Nacks

Exceptions in error handlers no longer prevent messages from being
`basic.nack`-ed.

### Pid File Support

`:pidfile` is a new configuration option that stores Hutch process
PID in a file at provided path.

Contributed by Rustam Sharshenov.

### More Info on Message

Bunny's `delivery_info`, `properties` and payload are now accessible on `Hutch::Message`.

Contributed by gregory.


### Optional Config Parameters

`Hutch::Config` constructor now accepts an extra hash of optional
configuration parameters.

Contributed by Ignazio Mostallino.


## 0.9.0 — May 13, 2014

### Platform-aware Signal Registration

Hutch will no longer attempt to register signal traps
for signals not supported by the environment (e.g. on by certain OSes).

Contributed by Tobias Matthies.

### TLS Fixes

Hutch now properly passes client TLS key and certificate to
Bunny.

Contributed by Eric Nelson.

### Bunny Update

Bunny is updated to 1.2.x which should offer
[much better latency](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/pull/187) for
workloads with lots of small messages published frequently.

### More Unit Testing Friendly CLI/Runner

`Hutch::CLI#run` now accepts a parameter and is easier to use
in automated tests.


## 0.8.0 — February 13, 2014

### Uncaught Exceptions Result in Rejected Messages

Uncaught exceptions in consumers now result in Hutch rejecting
messages (deliveries) using `basic.nack`. This way they are [dead lettered](http://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html).

Contributed by Garrett Johnson.

### Missing Require

`hutch/consumer.rb` no longer fails to load with the
apps that do not `require "set"`.

Contributed by Garrett Johnson.

### Relaxed Queue Namespace Validation

Namespaces now can include any characters that are valid in RabbitMQ
queue names.

Contributed by Garrett Johnson.

### basic.qos Configuration

It is now possible to configure `basic.qos` (aka channel prefetch) setting
used by Hutch using the `:channel_prefetch` config key.

### Passwords No Longer Logged

Hutch now elides passwords from logs.


## 0.7.0 — January 14, 2014

### Optional HTTP API Use

It is now possible to make Hutch [not use RabbitMQ HTTP
API](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch/pull/69) (e.g. when the
RabbitMQ management plugin that provides it is not available).


### Extra Arguments for Hutch::Broker#publish

Extra options [passed to `Hutch::Broker#publish` will now be propagated](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch/pull/61).


### Content-Type for Messages

Messages published with Hutch now have content type set
to `application/json`.


### Greater Heartbeat Interval

Hutch now uses heartbeat interval of 30, so heartbeats won't interfere with transfers
of large messages over high latency networks (e.g. between AWS availability regions).


### Custom Queue Names

It is now possible to [specify an optional queue name](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch/pull/49):

``` ruby
class FailedPaymentConsumer
  include Hutch::Consumer
  consume 'gc.ps.payment.failed'
  queue_name 'failed_payments'

  def process(message)
    mark_payment_as_failed(message[:id])
  end
end
```

### Global Properties for Publishers

[Global properties can now be specified](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch/pull/62) for publishing:

``` ruby
Hutch.global_properties = proc {
  { app_id: 'api', headers: { request_id: RequestId.request_id } }
}
```
